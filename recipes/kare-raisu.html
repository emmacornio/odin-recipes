    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kare Raisu, also known as curry-rice, is a japanese dish consistent of steamed rice and japanese curry</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup Short grain rice</li>
        <li>1 + 1/4 Cup Water </li>
        <li>1 Potato</li>
        <li>2 Carrots</li>
        <li>2 Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>A small chunk of ginger</li>
        <li>200 Grams chicken thighs</li>
        <li>½ liter of chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Soy</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Honey</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>25 Grams Curry Powder</li>
        <li>50 Grams Butter</li>
        <li>50 Grams flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the meat into bite-sized pieces. Cut potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic and ginger in the size you want. We recommend quartering the onions and dicing the potato. Chop the ginger and the garlic in very fine pieces.</li>
        <li>Parallel you can cook the rice already (see instructions). The easiest way is to cook it with the rice cooker, but a normal pot will also give the desired result.</li>
        <li>Fry the onions with ginger and garlic over medium heat with a little bit oil until the onions have a golden yellow color.</li>
        <li>Then add the meat and sauté briefly. If the meat sticks in the pan, add a bit more oil.</li>
        <li>Add stock, potatoes and carrots and set the cooker to low heat. Simmer for 20 minutes with the lid closed. But beware, it does not overcook!</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a pan.</li>
        <li>Add flour to melted butter to make a roux, cook for 5 minutes or until slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add curry powder and mix, remove from heat.</li>
        <li>When the soup has finished cooking, you can carefully remove the foam that has formed on the surface. Make sure that you do not wash away too much of the precious broth. In general, 2 tablespoons of foam per serving should suffice.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, add the curry roux and stir well for a few minutes, until thickens.</li>
        <li>Serve along with rice in a plate.</li>
    </ol>
